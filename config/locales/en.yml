# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      content: "<p>Okay, here is the truth about why I've made this blog. I wanted to go to cafés for a good reason (no kidding). We always go to cafés for everything -- for wifi, to chitchat, to read, literally for everything. I’m South Korean. In Korea, we have an amazing 'blog intranet'. Almost everyone is a blogger and whatever one might wonder, one can find on a blog (literally, EVERYTHING). That is the main reason I’m starting this blog. I know we already have <em>Timeout</em>, <em>Londonist</em>, <em>Quora</em> or whatever. But I have always wondered 'Why do they provide so little info? Are they getting paid to be quiet or something? I need more information mates!'</p><p>So here I am. I want to be your new mate, like Google and the rest. I know you must have already experienced some very unpleasant moments at cafés. For example, one day you wanted to spend your time at a café for as long as you wanted but they closed earlier than you expected, or there weren't proper fluffy seats for your lovely ass or the coffee tasted bad. In my case, I’m living in a shitty flat where the agency sometimes forgets to pay the internet bill, so my flatemates and I can’t use wifi at all. But as you may know, nowadays, there's no way we can spend a day without wifi. I really needed to apply for new jobs and had to write something on my old blog, and I needed some nice tunes.</p><p>I went out to a nice café, where I can enjoy nice coffee and amazing wifi (yes, I’m greedy that way). But it was pretty late (let’s not forget I am in London) and despite being downtown, the only place I could go to was Starbucks. I want to provide more informations about cafés, restaurants and every other place where one can spend time here in London.</p><p>We are living in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, using smartphone and we are spending our hard-earned money. Let's not waste our time and money uselessly. I really hope this blog can offer something to everyone and can be shared widely. I'll post as much as I can, and I hope to receive feedback from you, my dear readers. So please don’t hesitate to ask questions, push me for more interesting blog posts and ask me to write about new, interesting places. Thank you for reading my blog and as they say in Italian, enjoy <em>la dolce vita</em> my loves. XX.</p><p>-- Emma</p>"
